# Employee-Tracker


# Introduction to the project
* This program runs with Node JS from the command line and allows a human resources administrator to manage all the employees, departments and roles.

# About this project 
* In the first place, when the user enters the application, the app shows to the user a options menu (user friendly) and in the first options the app allows the user to see different views of the database such as: view departments, view all roles and view all employees. The views are organized with SQL queries.

* The application also allows the user to add new departments, new roles and new employees and also to update employee roles.
